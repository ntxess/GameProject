# Simple Game Engine

A simple 2D game engine built in C++.

Libraries used in project include: SFML, EnTT, ImGui, and Thor.

Theres a lot of simulations going on in some of the games. Most likely will crash with the current preset resolution.
Recompiling with a smaller resolution is recommended if crashes.
